Part 2 Discussion
1. If it were always 17, there would really be no need to ask for a number as it
would be 17 either way. Inside the for loop, the n variable would just be changed
to 17.

Part 3 Discussion
1. We would have to make sure that the results that are being tested match what was being printed.
By using the assert equals method, we would be able to check if the two values were equal
or not.


Part 4 Discussion
1. In parts 2, 3, and 4, there changes in the methods used to provide a specific results.
Like in part 2, the result was just simply printed, where as in parts 3 and 4, the results 
were used and stored elsewhere, whether it'd be in an array, or a list (which you can do more with). Some consistent 
aspects of the different parts included the base of the whole project, which was to
find and record the concept of fizz buzz. As for implementations, we feel like as long as 
both types of data are being stored inside the list, implementations shouldn't conflict as 
much.
